# ✅ TASK COMPLETED: Date Range Picker

I have successfully updated the Demand Forecasting page to use a calendar-based date picker!

## 📅 **New Feature: Custom Date Range**

### **1. Date Selection**
- **From/To Inputs**: Replaced the simple "Change Period" button with specific **Start Date** and **End Date** pickers.
- **Calendar Interface**: Clicking the date opens the browser's native calendar for easy selection of day, month, and year.
- **Validation**: Automatically adjusts dates to ensure the "From" date is never after the "To" date.

### **2. Dynamic Forecasting**
- **Adaptive Charts**: The forecast chart now dynamically adjusts its x-axis based on the number of days selected (e.g., selecting a 14-day range shows 14 data points).
- **Metrics Update**: The "Forecast Range" metric now displays the exact number of days in your selected custom period.

2. Look for the date inputs in the top right (labeled **From** and **To**).
3. Click on a date to open the calendar and pick a new range.
4. Click **Run Forecast** to generate predictions for your specific dates.

**You now have full control over the forecast timeline!** 🎉
