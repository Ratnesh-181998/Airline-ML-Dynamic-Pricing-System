# ✅ TASK COMPLETED: Market Analytics Actions

I have successfully implemented the requested features on the Market Analytics page!

## 📊 **New Features Added**

### **1. Date Range Picker** 📅
- **Custom Period**: Replaced the static "Change Period" button with **From** and **To** date inputs.
- **Interactive**: Changing dates automatically refreshes the charts with new simulated data.

### **2. Export Report** 📥
- **Functionality**: Clicking **Export Report** now simulates generating and downloading a PDF report.
- **Feedback**: Shows a "Downloading..." state and a success notification upon completion.

### **3. Interactive Insights** 💡
- **Clickable Cards**: The "Peak Season", "Emerging Routes", and "Price Optimization" cards are now interactive.
- **Detail View**: Clicking a card triggers a popup (toast) simulating the loading of a detailed analysis breakdown for that specific insight.
