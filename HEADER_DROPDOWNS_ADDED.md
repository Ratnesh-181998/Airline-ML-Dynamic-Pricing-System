## ⚠️ **Note About Sidebar System Menu**

The sidebar has "Data Sources", "System Health", and "Settings" items. These are currently placeholders. To make them work, we would need to:

1. Create new page components (like we did for Demand Forecasting, Market Analytics, Anomaly Detection)
2. Add them to the App.js routing
3. Implement the UI for each page

Would you like me to implement these pages as well?
